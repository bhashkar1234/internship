Testimonial Carousel Project
This project is a Testimonial Carousel that uses Bootstrap 5 for a simple, responsive design. The carousel allows users to cycle through testimonials, each of which includes a circular profile image, a testimonial text, the person's name, and their job title.

Technologies Used
HTML: To structure the content of the testimonials.
CSS: For basic styling of the layout and carousel elements.
Bootstrap 5: Used for the carousel functionality, responsiveness, and layout design.
JavaScript (Bootstrap's Bundle): Bootstrapâ€™s carousel functionality is powered by JavaScript to enable transitions and controls.
Features
Carousel Transition: Testimonials auto-slide at regular intervals. Users can also manually navigate through testimonials using the previous and next buttons.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop.
Profile Images: Each testimonial displays a circular profile image along with the review.
